# Help Wanted
I need assistance in getting this working under VHBL.

# Likely Issues
ONElua seems to be bundling a kernel exploit to allow it to run on OFW, which causes VHBL to instantly close the game.
Either the kernel exploit needs to be removed, or the homebrew needs to be re-written based on [ONEmenu](https://github.com/ONElua/ONEmenu/)'s EBOOT.PBP which uses a lower(?) version of ONElua that doesn't bundle a kexploit.
